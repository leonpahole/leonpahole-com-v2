**Hello**, everyone! This is my first blog post ever.

I am planning to write one blog post per week.

I think that writing blog posts will allow me to remember and understand my topics of interest more deeply, as I will need to research more to be able to write about them. Hopefully, as a byproduct, someone might stumble upon my blog posts and find them useful for learning :).

_See you soon!_
