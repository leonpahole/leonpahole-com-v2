At the core of every front-end web app is integration with the server. This involves the following processes:

- Calling the server endpoint
- Handling potential errors (update: here's the error handling blog post: [How I handle frontend errors](/blog/how-i-handle-frontend-errors))
- Converting the data from the server to the structure used on the front-end and validating it (if needed)

When I write front-end code, I like to abstract things as much as possible so the logic for the communication with the server is not in the UI components. In addition, I like to group related endpoint calls and models by domain. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

Let's look at how I structure my front-end projects for server communication.

## Folder structure

I store everything related to server communication in a folder, which I usually name `util`. Then, I create subfolders for different domains in the app. Each of the subfolders can have the file for the `service`, `models`, `api` and `errors`.

```
├── util                       // Communication with the server
|  ├── auth                    // Everything for authentication (login, registration, ...)
|  |  ├── auth.service.ts
|  |  ├── auth.models.ts
|  |  ├── auth.api.ts
|  |  └── auth.errors.ts
|  ├── blogPost                 // Everything for blog posts (listing, creating, deleting, ...)
|  |  ├── blogPost.service.ts
|  |  ├── blogPost.models.ts
|  |  ├── blogPost.api.ts
|  |  └── blogPost.errors.ts
|  └── ...
└── ...
```

Note: I could name the files inside each respective folder without the domain prefix (eg. `auth/service.ts` instead of `auth/auth.service.ts`), but I prefer explicit names, as it's easier to search for them.

### The models

The `<domain>.models.ts` file contains all models for a given domain and any logic that may be needed for these models. I store the models in a `namespace`, which is [my preferred way to group related functionality](/blog/ts-namespaces).

Here's how `blogPost.models.ts` might look like (comments added for explanation purposes):

```ts
export namespace BlogPostModels {
  // public model
  export interface Post {
    id: number;

    title: string;
    excerpt: string;

    author: UserModels.User; // reference external model

    type: Type; // reference internal, private model

    postedAt: Date;
  }

  // private model
  type Type = "announcement" | "regular";

  // utility function that operates on the model
  export const getReadingTimeInMinutes = (post: Post): number => {
    // ...
  };

  // optional: convert / validate from server-side DTO to the model
  export const fromPostDto = (post: PostDto): Post => {
    // ...
  };
}
```

This example demonstrates different entities that can be stored in the `models` namespace:

- Declaration of models used in the front-end code - both public (`Post`) and private (`Type`).
- Declaration of utility functions that operate on the models.
- Declaration of functions that convert and validate models from the backend - this is useful when we want to use a different data structure on the front-end than what's returned from the back-end.

<br />

### The api

The `<domain>.api.ts` file contains all API calls for a given domain. Its only job is to call the API and return the result (whether it is successful or not). Let's look at the blog example.

```typescript
export namespace BlogPostApi {
  export const list = async (): Promise<PostDto[]> => {
    return Rest.get(`...`);
  };

  export const get = async (id: number): Promise<PostDto> => {
    // ...
  };

  export const create = async (data: PostDto): Promise<PostDto> => {
    // ...
  };

  export const delete = async (id: number): Promise<void> => {
    // ...
  };
}
```

The `api` only calls the server and returns the result (in raw object response format). In this example, we are assuming that the `PostDto` is the server-side structure that needs to be converted to `Post` for use in the front-end. The `api` does not do the conversion though - it is only aware of server-side entities - the endpoints and the DTOs.

If an error occurs, the `api` should throw. This is why the return types of functions are always typed in a way that assumes a successful response. In this example, if `get()` fails, we assume that the backend threw a `404 Not found` error.

Another thing to note is that the names of all of the functions in the `api` are general - we can afford to do this because the functions are protected with the `namespace`. When we will call these functions, the call itself will thus be readable (for example `BlogPostApi.list()` tells us exactly what it does).

### The errors

The `<domain>.errors.ts` file contains the logic and entities that are used when communicating with the server goes wrong. Because error handling is a complex topic itself, I will write a separate blog post covering how I handle errors. However, if you use your own system of handling errors, the `errors` file would be the place to store the logic for this system (under a `namespace`).

Update: here's the error handling blog post: [How I handle frontend errors](/blog/how-i-handle-frontend-errors).

### The service

The `<domain>.service.ts` file is where everything comes together. This file contains functions that perform the business logic of the application. This involves the following processes:

- Calling (one or multiple) `api` functions
- Converting and validating the result from the `api` using `models`
- Handling `errors`

Here's a full example of a service method for creating a blog post:

```typescript
export namespace BlogPostService {
  export const create = async (data: BlogPostModels.Post): Promise<BlogPostModels.Post> => {
    try {
      const request = BlogPostModels.toPostDto(data); // convert to server data structure
      const response = await BlogPostApi.create(request); // call the server
      return BlogPostModels.fromPostDto(response); // convert to front-end data structure
    } catch (e) {
      // this is how I handle errors, stay tuned for my error handling blog post for more information
      throw BlogPostModels.Create.getError(e);
    }
  };

  export const list = async (): Promise<BlogPostModels.Post[]> => {
    // ...
  };
}
```

The `service` calls the `models` to convert between data structures (might not be needed, depending on the way you structure your data), the `api` to make the server call, and the `errors` to gracefully handle the error.

A `service` can do more complex things as well - for example, it can call the server multiple times. Let's say that a `Post` can have one or more `Tag`s, but the server is written in a way that requires us to make a separate API call to attach tags to blog posts. Here's what the `service` might look like:

```typescript
export namespace BlogPostService {
  export const create = async (data: BlogPostModels.Post, tags: BlogPostModels.Tag[]): Promise<BlogPostModels.Post> => {
    const post = await createBasic(data);
    return await attachTags(post.id, tags);
  };

  const createBasic = async (data: BlogPostModels.Post): Promise<BlogPostModels.Post> => {
    // same as above
  };

  const attachTags = async (id: number, tags: Tag[]): Promise<BlogPostModels.Post> => {
    // ...
  };
}
```

In this example, the `create` operation has been divided into two sub-functions. Notice how we have renamed `create` to `createBasic` and made it private - I prefer to keep the names of public functions clear and readable, hence I renamed the private function.

The `create` function doesn't handle any errors - this is because `createBasic` and `attachTags` should include that logic. What the `create` function could handle is that if `attachTags` fails, it may want to retry the operation or fail silently.

## Usage in UI

Finally, we can use our structure in the UI. The only entities that should be used are the `service` and `models`.

```ts
const onCreateClick = () => {
  try {
    const post = await BlogPostService.create(data);
    navigate(`post/${post.id}`);
  } catch (e) {
    // handle error, stay tuned for the error handling blog post for more information
  }
};
```

## Other utilites

I don't use the `util` folder exclusively for server communication. I like to store general utilities in it as well, such as `math/math.utils.ts` for various math functions or `string/string.utils.ts` for string processing utilities. All of these utilities are protected with a `namespace`. Here's an example of `string.utils.ts`:

```typescript
export namespace StringUtils {
  export const toInt = (num: string | null | undefined): number | null => {
    if (num == null) {
      return null;
    }

    const parsed = Number(num);
    if (parsed == null || Number.isNaN(parsed)) {
      return null;
    }

    return parsed;
  };

  export const isNotBlank = (str: string | null | undefined): boolean => {
    if (!str) {
      return false;
    }

    return str.trim().length > 0;
  };
}
```

## Benefits

I really love working with this folder structure. Here are the benefits I have observed so far:

- It makes naming things easier. I no longer need to worry if the name of the function or interface clashes with another name, because everything is protected with a `namespace`.
- It makes the UI code more readable because the code only calls the `service` and doesn't deal with the rest of the complexities behind the client-server communication.
- It is more robust against change - most of the modifications are done in the `util` folder.
- It establishes an easy-to-follow process for handling communication with the server, so it is useful when working in a large team.

## Bonus: React Query queries

Recently I've been using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) a lot. I've thus started adding another file inside my `util/<domain>` folders for query hooks. Here's an example of `blogPost.queries.ts`:

```typescript
export namespace BlogPostQueries {
  const blogPostsKey = () => "blogPosts";

  export const useList = () => useQuery(blogPostsKey(), () => BlogPostService.list());

  const blogPostKey = (id: number) => ["blogPosts", id];

  export const useGet = (id: number) => useQuery(boardKey(id), () => BlogPostService.get(id));

  export const useCreate = () => {
    const queryClient = useQueryClient();

    return useMutation({
      mutationFn: (request: BlogPostModels.CreateRequest) => {
        return BlogPostService.create(request);
      },
      // handle query updates here as well
      onSuccess: (newBlogPost) => {
        queryClient.setQueryData(blogPostsKey(), (oldBlogPosts: BlogPostModels.Post[] | undefined) => {
          if (!oldBlogPosts) {
            return [newBlogPost];
          }

          return [newBlogPost, ...oldBlogPosts];
        });

        queryClient.setQueryData(blogPostKey(newBlogPost.id), () => {
          return newBlogPost;
        });
      },
    });
  };
}
```

And the usage is as follows:

```typescript
const { data: blogPosts, isLoading, error } = BlogPostQueries.useList();
```

<br />

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I went over the service-models-api-errors(-queries) structure that I use in every front-end project that I start. I like working with this structure because it makes things simpler and more manageable. However, I think that every team should adapt their structure to whatever makes them the most productive - hopefully, this blog post has motivated you to do just that.

Stay tuned for my error handling blog post, which will delve into the details of error handling using this structure.
